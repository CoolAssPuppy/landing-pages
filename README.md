# Landing Pages

Open-source landing page templates built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS 4, and shadcn/ui. Define pages as TypeScript configuration objects and deploy production-ready campaigns in minutes.

## Setup in 30 seconds

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd landing-pages
npm install
```

1. **Open `src/config/site.ts`** -- set your company name, logo paths, nav links, and footer.
2. **Drop your logo files in `public/images/`** -- set both `logo.light` and `logo.dark` paths in the config. If you only have one logo, set both to the same path.
3. **Replace `public/favicon.svg`** with your own favicon.
4. **Pick a color theme (optional)** -- open `src/app/globals.css`, comment out the Neutral theme, and uncomment one of the four presets (Blue, Green, Violet, Orange).
5. **Deploy** -- push to Vercel, point your subdomain, done.

```bash
npm run dev        # preview locally at http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # verify production build
```

### Custom domain setup

After deploying to Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project **Settings > Domains**
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., `go.your-domain.com`)
3. At your domain registrar, add a CNAME record:
   - **Name**: `go` (or whatever subdomain you chose)
   - **Value**: `cname.vercel-dns.com`
4. Wait for DNS propagation (usually under 5 minutes)

Vercel handles SSL certificates automatically.

## Features

- **Data-driven pages**: Define pages as TypeScript configuration objects -- no custom React needed
- **Nine page templates**: Lead generation, thank you, legal/rules, waitlist, resource hub, partner co-marketing, comparison, pricing, webinar
- **Secure form handling**: CSRF protection, rate limiting, input sanitization, Content-Security-Policy headers
- **Marketing integrations**: HubSpot Forms/Contacts API, Customer.io Track API with configurable events

## Creating a new landing page

The fastest way to create a new landing page:

1. Copy an example from `data/pages/examples/` into `data/pages/`
2. Change the `slug` to your desired URL path
3. Update the content (title, description, form fields, etc.)
4. Import and register the page in `data/pages/index.ts`
5. Run `npm run dev` and visit `http://localhost:3000/your-slug`

```typescript
// data/pages/my-campaign.ts
import type { LeadGenPageConfig } from "@/types/page-config";

export const myCampaignPage: LeadGenPageConfig = {
  type: "lead-gen",
  slug: "my-campaign",
  metadata: {
    title: "My Campaign",
    description: "Campaign description for SEO.",
  },
  hero: {
    title: "Main headline",
    description: "Value proposition for your campaign.",
    ctas: [{ label: "Get started", href: "#form", variant: "default" }],
  },
  form: {
    title: "Sign up",
    submitLabel: "Submit",
    fields: [
      { name: "email", label: "Email", type: "email", required: true },
    ],
  },
};
```

```typescript
// data/pages/index.ts
import { myCampaignPage } from "./my-campaign";

export const pages: PageConfig[] = [
  // ... existing pages
  myCampaignPage,
];
```

## Skinning and customization

This section covers how to adapt the template system for your own product, brand, and content. It is written for both human developers and LLM coding assistants.

### Theming

This project uses standard [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) theming. All colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`.

#### Changing the color palette

Edit the CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`. The key variables are:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `--background` | Page background |
| `--foreground` | Default text color |
| `--card` | Card and section backgrounds |
| `--primary` | Buttons, links, accent elements |
| `--primary-foreground` | Text on primary-colored backgrounds |
| `--muted` | Subtle backgrounds (feature sections, code blocks) |
| `--muted-foreground` | Secondary text, descriptions |
| `--border` | Borders and dividers |
| `--destructive` | Error states |

Both `:root` (light) and `.dark` (dark) themes need updating.

#### Built-in color presets

The file `src/app/globals.css` ships with five complete themes: Neutral (active by default), Blue, Green, Violet, and Orange. To switch:

1. Open `src/app/globals.css`
2. Comment out the active `:root` and `.dark` blocks (labeled `NEUTRAL THEME`)
3. Uncomment the preset you want (e.g., `BLUE THEME`)
4. Rebuild

Each preset is a complete pair of light and dark mode variables. No need to understand OKLCH -- just uncomment and go.

#### Using shadcn themes

You can also grab a theme from [ui.shadcn.com/themes](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes):

1. Pick a theme and copy the CSS variables
2. Replace the active `:root` and `.dark` blocks in `src/app/globals.css`
3. Keep the `@theme inline` block, prose styles, and code block colors as they are

### Branding

#### Logo

Set your logo paths in `src/config/site.ts`. The component reads from the config automatically:

```typescript
logo: {
  light: "/images/your-logo.png",       // shown in light mode
  dark: "/images/your-logo-white.png",  // shown in dark mode
  height: 32,                            // rendered height in pixels
},
```

Drop your logo files in `public/images/`. If you only have one logo, set both `light` and `dark` to the same path.

#### Site configuration

Edit `src/config/site.ts` to set your company name, description, URL, logo, nav links, and footer:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  name: "Your Product",
  description: "Your product description",
  url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || "http://localhost:3000",
  logo: {
    light: "/images/your-logo.png",
    dark: "/images/your-logo-white.png",
    height: 32,
  },
  nav: [
    { label: "Product", href: "https://your-domain.com" },
    { label: "Docs", href: "https://docs.your-domain.com" },
  ],
  footer: {
    company: "Your Company, Inc.",
    links: [
      { label: "Privacy Policy", href: "/privacy" },
      { label: "Terms of Service", href: "/terms" },
    ],
  },
};
```

#### Fonts

Change the font in `src/app/layout.tsx`. The default uses Inter from Google Fonts:

```typescript
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";

const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  variable: "--font-inter",
  display: "swap",
});
```

Replace `Inter` with any Google Font. The CSS variable `--font-inter` is referenced in `globals.css` under `--font-family-sans`.

### Writing effective page configs

**Hero sections**: Lead with a clear value proposition. Keep titles under 10 words. Use `subtitle` for context and `description` for the supporting paragraph.

**Content blocks**: Use the `cards` variant for feature grids. Three columns works well for 3-6 items. Use Lucide icon names (e.g., `"database"`, `"shield"`, `"zap"`) for consistency.

**Forms**: Keep forms short. Every additional field reduces conversion. For lead gen, start with email only and add fields as needed. Always include `gdprText` for compliance.

**Social proof**: Stats, testimonials, and logos each serve different purposes. Stats are quick credibility signals. Testimonials build trust. Logo clouds establish market presence.

**CTAs**: Use `variant: "default"` for primary actions and `variant: "outline"` for secondary. Link CTAs to `"#form"` to scroll to the form section.

### Icons

Content blocks support Lucide icons by name:

```typescript
{ icon: "database", title: "Feature", description: "Description" }
```

Or pass JSX icon elements directly for full control.

## Configuration

### Site config

Edit `src/config/site.ts` to customize the site name, description, URL, and footer.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CSRF_SECRET` | Yes | Secret for CSRF token signing. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` | No | HubSpot private app access token |
| `CUSTOMERIO_SITE_ID` | No | Customer.io site ID |
| `CUSTOMERIO_API_KEY` | No | Customer.io Track API key |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` | No | Google Analytics 4 measurement ID |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | No | Base URL for metadata and canonical URLs |

### Form field types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `text` | Single-line text input |
| `email` | Email input with validation |
| `tel` | Phone number input |
| `textarea` | Multi-line text input |
| `select` | Dropdown select (requires `options` array) |
| `checkbox` | Checkbox (for consent/opt-in) |

## Marketing integrations

All integration libraries live in `src/lib/integrations/`. The front end is completely decoupled from the integrations layer -- forms submit to `/api/form`, and the route handler calls whichever integrations are configured. No front-end changes are needed to add or swap integrations.

### How it works

```
Browser form  -->  /api/form (route.ts)  -->  src/lib/integrations/hubspot.ts
                                          -->  src/lib/integrations/customerio.ts
                                          -->  (your integration here)
```

Each integration library:
- Lives in `src/lib/integrations/` as a standalone file
- Exports async functions that accept sanitized form data
- Reads its own credentials from environment variables
- Returns a result type (`{ success: true }` or `{ success: false; error: string }`)
- Fails gracefully when not configured (no env vars = no-op, no crash)

The route handler in `src/app/api/form/route.ts` calls each integration conditionally based on what is configured in the form config and what environment variables are set.

### Built-in integrations

#### HubSpot (CRM + forms)

**What it does:** Submits form data to HubSpot via the Forms API, or creates/updates contacts via the Contacts API as a fallback.

**Setup:**
1. Create a HubSpot private app with Forms and Contacts scopes
2. Set `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env.local`
3. Add `hubspotPortalId` and `hubspotFormId` to your form config

```typescript
form: {
  hubspotPortalId: "12345678",
  hubspotFormId: "abcd1234-5678-90ef-ghij-klmnopqrstuv",
  fields: [
    { name: "firstName", label: "First name", type: "text", required: true },
    { name: "email", label: "Email", type: "email", required: true },
  ],
}
```

Field `name` values must match HubSpot internal field names exactly.

#### Customer.io (event tracking)

**What it does:** Creates/updates customer profiles and tracks custom events with metadata.

**Setup:**
1. Set `CUSTOMERIO_SITE_ID` and `CUSTOMERIO_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. Add `customerio` config to your form

```typescript
form: {
  customerio: {
    eventName: "ebook_download",
    metadata: {
      resource_type: "ebook",
      resource_name: "my-ebook",
    },
  },
}
```

The email field is used as the customer identifier. Events and metadata appear in your Customer.io workspace.

### Adding a new integration

We welcome contributions of additional integration libraries. Salesforce, Marketo, Mailchimp, Brevo, ActiveCampaign, Intercom -- if your marketing stack uses it, it belongs here.

To add a new integration:

1. Create a new file in `src/lib/integrations/` (e.g., `salesforce.ts`)
2. Export async functions that accept form data and send it to the API
3. Read credentials from environment variables (e.g., `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID`)
4. Return `{ success: true }` or `{ success: false; error: string }`
5. Handle the "not configured" case gracefully (return early if env vars are missing)
6. Add the call to `src/app/api/form/route.ts` alongside the existing HubSpot and Customer.io calls
7. Add any new `FormConfig` fields to `src/types/page-config.ts` if needed
8. Add the new environment variables to `.env.example`
9. Export from `src/lib/integrations/index.ts`

The front end stays untouched. Forms already send all config and field data to the API route -- your integration just needs to pick up the data it cares about on the server side.

## Security

- **CSRF protection**: HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens with 1-hour expiry
- **Rate limiting**: 20 req/min for API routes, 5 req/min for form submissions
- **Input sanitization**: XSS pattern detection, HTML entity encoding, field length validation
- **Bot detection**: User agent validation, timing-based rejection
- **Security headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options

## Example: skinning for your own product

This walkthrough shows what it would take to rebrand all the example pages to market a fictional "Velocity" -- a Next.js server framework with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui built in.

### Global changes

1. **Site config** (`src/config/site.ts`): Change name to "Velocity", description to "The Next.js server framework with Tailwind and shadcn built in", company to "Velocity Labs"

2. **Logo** (`src/components/ui/site-logo.tsx`): Replace with Velocity's logo or use a different Lucide icon (e.g., `Rocket`)

3. **Theme** (`src/app/globals.css`): Pick a color theme that matches Velocity's brand. A blue or violet primary would work well for a developer tool.

4. **Font** (`src/app/layout.tsx`): Consider a more technical font like JetBrains Mono for headings or stick with Inter for clean readability.

### Per-template changes

**Lead gen (example-ebook.tsx)** -- Turn into a "Velocity Quickstart Guide" download:
- Hero title: "The Velocity Quickstart Guide"
- Hero description: "Learn how to build production-ready apps with Next.js server components, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui in under an hour."
- Content blocks: Replace with Velocity-specific features (server components, streaming SSR, built-in auth, edge deployment)
- Form: Keep email + role fields, change submit label to "Download Guide"

**Waitlist (example-waitlist.ts)** -- Turn into "Velocity 2.0 Early Access":
- Hero title: "Velocity 2.0"
- Badge: "Coming Soon"
- Features: Highlight new v2 capabilities (React Server Components, partial prerendering, built-in caching)
- Countdown: Set to your actual launch date

**Resource hub (example-resources.ts)** -- Turn into "Velocity Developer Hub":
- Resources: Framework docs, migration guides, video tutorials, case studies from companies using Velocity
- Code snippet: Show a Velocity server component example
- Categories: "Getting Started", "Server Components", "Data Fetching", "Deployment"

**Partner (example-partner.ts)** -- Turn into "Velocity + Vercel" integration page:
- Partner logo: Vercel
- Value proposition: Seamless deployment, edge runtime, preview deployments
- Big quote: A testimonial from the Vercel team
- Offer: Free Vercel Pro tier for Velocity users

**Comparison (example-comparison.tsx)** -- Turn into "Velocity vs. Create React App":
- Comparison table: SSR support, bundle size, routing, data fetching, deployment
- Split sections: Show side-by-side code examples
- Timeline: Migration steps from CRA to Velocity
- FAQ: Common questions about switching frameworks

**Pricing (example-pricing.ts)** -- Turn into "Velocity Pro Plans":
- Tiers: Free (open source), Pro ($29/mo for hosted services), Enterprise (custom pricing)
- Features: Differentiate by deployment limits, support tiers, analytics

**Webinar (example-webinar.ts)** -- Turn into "Building with Velocity: Live Workshop":
- Speakers: Framework maintainers or developer advocates
- Agenda: Setup, building a feature, deployment, Q&A
- Platform: Use Zoom or YouTube Live URL

### Messaging tips

- Lead with developer experience: "Ship faster", "Less config, more code"
- Emphasize the integrated stack: Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn is the pitch
- Use code examples as proof points -- developers trust code over marketing copy
- Keep the tone direct and technical, avoid buzzwords
- Reference real Next.js and React concepts (server components, streaming, suspense) to build credibility
